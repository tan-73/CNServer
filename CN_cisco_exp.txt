// 6. ICMP-Test connectivity

add 3 pc +1 switch + router(2811) + 1 switch + 3 pc 

connect all the components 

got to router change the interface 192.168.1.1 and for interface 2 192.168.2.1


got to pcs and assign ip address for all
change the default gateway of all the pc of interface 1 to 192.168.1.1 similarly for interface 2 add 192.168.2.1

add PDU to any 2 pc and run the simulation

And explain the theory

-------------------------------------------

// DHCP and DNS

(interface 1 - 3 pc, 1 switch) - router - (interface 2 - 3 server DHCP, DNS, Web server) + 1 pc 

Connect every component 

Firstly in router for interface 1 add ip address - 192.168.1.1

In router for interface 2 add ip address - 192.168.2.1 . Also enable the router 

In DHCP server add ipconfig and add the ip address 192.168.2.2 and default gateway as same as interface 1(192.168.2.1)

Follow the same procedure and for dns server address, add the DNS ip address

In DHCP and DNS enable the servies 

Now for the pc ipconfig and enable DHCP

# Now to make the interface 1 take DHCP address

Go to DHCP server add serverpool with enter def.gateway and DNS addr. and start from 2 -> 10\

Similarly, DHCP server add serverpool1 with enter def.gateway of interface 1 and DNS addr. and start from 1 -> 10

CLI commands in router :

exit 
enable
configure t
interface FastEthernet 0/0
ip helper-address 192.168.2.2
no shutdown
do write memory

now open pc and add DHCP 

# Now we are done with DHCP
 

# For DNS

Go to Dns server and add a name as "example"
and add webserver ip addesss(192.168.2.4)

Open the interface 1 pc and click on http browser
Type the name (example)

u'll get some links

Done
